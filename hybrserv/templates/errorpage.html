	Hybridization rate computation is based on First Step Mode. 
	The computation ends when N successful trajectories are found or after max(N,30) seconds, whichever occurs earlier.
	The maximum sequence length is 100 nt. 
	Dissociation and toehold-mediated branch migration rate computation is based on an unpublished rare event simulation method.	
	The simulation starts N trials with timeout 0.2ms along each point in a predetermined pathway. The computation time is unrestricted.
	Dissociation: The maximum sequence length is 20 nt. 
	Threeway branch migration: The sum of sequence lengths should be less than 50 nt.   <br>
